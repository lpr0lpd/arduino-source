Input from 4x4 matrix keypad to ouput dtmf and mf tones. 

MF all digits 0-9 represent themselves and
KP = * 

ST = # 

2600Hz = A

. B,C,D currently unused

DTMF all keys are mapped to represent themselves.

Very basic code right now. Will be adding code to switch from DTMF to MF 
and vice-vera. Plan on adding ability to store sequences.
